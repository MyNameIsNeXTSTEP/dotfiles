# Dotfiles

This repository contains my configurations files on:
- tmux
- neovim
- brew
- zsh/bash
- macos

To update locally dorfiles in the repositpry i use `import.sh` script as executable.

> Notice, that the import mechanism states that dotfiles are taken from the same places as declared in the script.
